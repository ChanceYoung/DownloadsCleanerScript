# DownloadsCleanerScript

This is a script adapted from the open-source solution provided by geeksambhu.
The original script can be found at: https://geeksambhu.github.io/python/2018/08/09/organize-your-downloads-directory-mess.html

This is a python script designed to organize your downloads folder into subdirectories when run. 

My modifications:
Created a new "Extracted" folder that will be populated with any directories created from extracting folders found in the "Zipped" folder.
Created a procedure to delete all files or folders not contained within the curated list of organized folders or the .ini layout file provided by default by the Microsoft File system.
